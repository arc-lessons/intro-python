Without getting into the specifics or philosophy of maths or computing, it is good to have an appreciation for what is going on, how computers represent numbers and how they resolve undefined quantities.\n",

    "\n",
    "Programming languages have to represent numbers in a finite amount of computer memory and in order to enable this they typically have two classes of numbers: `integers`, the discrete values, and `real` numbers or floating point numbers, `floats`, the continuous number line. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Integers` and `floats` are data types in the same way as the `string` that we saw earlier, except that rather than representing characters they represent numerical values.  When Python performs a calculation it examines the values entered and what you are trying to do and makes a decision how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2. In order to print numbers we do not need to enclose them in parentheses, numerical values are different from `strings` of characters.\n",
    "* 3. When we asked `7+1` the entire calculation could be evaluated as integers, `7`, `1` and `8` are all integers.\n",
    "* 4. In specifying `7.0+1` the `7.0` meant the whole calculation was treated as floating point, so the result was given as `8.0`\n",
    "* 5. and 6. When performing division, regardless of the representation Python cannot know what the result will be so assumes that it will be a float.\n",
    "* 7. and 8. Integer division by zero is not defined.\n",
    "* 9. Neither is floating point division by zero but the error is slightly different\n",
    "* 10. and 11.  Only a finite amount of space, `memory` is available for representing numbers.  One result of this is that at a certain point adding a realtively `small` number to a relatively `big` one does not change the big one.\n",
