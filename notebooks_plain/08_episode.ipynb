We must make use of libraries, which is where most of the power of a programming language lies:\n- A library is a collection of files (called modules) that contains functions for use by other programs.\n- May also contain data values (e.g. numerical constants) and other things.\n- Library’s contents are supposed to be related, but there’s no way to enforce that.\n- The Python standard library is an extensive suite of modules that comes with Python itself.\n- Many additional libraries are available from PyPI (the Python Package Index).\n- The Anaconda package also contains or can help install many useful scientific libraries"

The `sqrt(x)` function is arguably more readable than `pow(x, 0.5)` when implementing equations. Readability is a cornerstone of good programming, so it makes sense to provide a special function for this specific common case.\n\nAlso the `math` libraries are likely to be written in an optimsed way.
