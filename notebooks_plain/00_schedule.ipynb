We use Python in our lessons because:\n\n- we have to use something for examples\n- it’s free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere\n- it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists\n- experience shows that it’s easier for novices to pick up than most other languages.\n\nBut the two most important things are to use whatever language your colleagues are using, so that you can share your work with them easily, and to use that language well.\n"
