Then we have the **condition** which typically makes a comparison between two values, in our example, the value stored in `num` and the value `100`\n3. The condition is that the first value should be greater, `>`, than the second value.\n4. If the condition is `True` we execute the **body** that follows.\n\nAn `elif` statement is essentially the same as an `if` statement except that it can only follow an `if`, or another `elif`.  It has a separate condition and also causes the **body** following it to be executed if the condition is `True`.\nAn `else` statement allows us to execute a further **body** of code if none of the preceeding conditions are `True`.\n\nIn Python, similar to what we saw in loops, the statements `if`, `elif` and `else`, must be followed by a colon ':' and the **body** of code following them must be indented."
