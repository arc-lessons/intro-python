If you edit a code cell and don't run _all_ the code cells after it, then any cell that isn't re-executed is still using the old code. Jupyter allows you to keep track of this by numbering its input, `In [3]` for instance means this block was executed third.\n\nIf you get in a complete mess you can also clear all output, without removing the input and re-execute the code blocks in order.\n\nFor your learning we would recommend during this course that you never go back and change anything.  Just re-write the code in the next cell.  This way you will have a record of everything you have done, examples of common mistakes which you can refer back to in order to reinforce your learning."
