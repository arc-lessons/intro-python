The following instructions are intended for use on the `linux.bath`, if you are running on your own computer use your home directory in place of the `H-drive`.\n\nMake a new folder in your working directory, the `H-drive`, called `python-novice-inflammation`.\n\nDownload [python-novice-inflammation-data.zip](../data/python-novice-inflammation-data.zip) and move the file to this folder.\n\nAlso download [python-novice-inflammation-code.zip](../data/python-novice-inflammation-code.zip) and move it to the same folder.\n\nThese files need to be unzipped, we will do this through linux. Open `linux.bath.ac.uk` through xming:\n\n- ‘Start’ → All Programs → Xming → linux\n\nnavigate to the directory containing the files you downloaded and unzip them using the following commands:\n```bash\n% cd python-novice-inflammation/\n% unzip python-novice-inflammation-data.zip\n% unzip python-novice-inflammation-code.zip\n```\n\nYou should end up with two new folders called data and code.\n\nTo get started, go into the data folder from the Unix shell with:\n\n```bash\n% cd data\n```\nWe will be using the IPython interpreter for this lesson, on linux.bath.ac.uk this is launched by typing the command:\n```bash\n% ipython3\n```\nNote the `3`, this refers to a specific version of Python, changes in its behaviour mean that you will observe different results in certain exercises.  This Python interpreter can be installed on your own computer using this link [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). This also includes the Jupyter notebook functionality an exciting way of producing reproducible data analysis."
