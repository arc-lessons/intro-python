    "2. Then we have the **condition** which typically makes a comparison between two values, in our example, the value stored in `num` and the value `100`\n",
    "3. The condition is that the first value should be greater, `>`, than the second value.\n",
    "4. If the condition is `True` we execute the **body** that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `elif` statement is essentially the same as an `if` statement except that it can only follow an `if`, or another `elif`.  It has a separate condition and also causes the **body** following it to be executed if the condition is `True`.\n",
    "An `else` statement allows us to execute a further **body** of code if none of the preceeding conditions are `True`.\n",
    "\n",
