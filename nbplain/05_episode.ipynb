Python uses the keyword `for` to specify that we are entering a loop.\n2. This is followed by the name of the **loop variable** we wish to use in the loop.\n3. Python requires the keyword `in` to follow the loop variable.  \n4. This is followed by the **collection** of values that we wish to loop over.\n5. Python then requires a colon `:` to indicate that we have specified the conditions of the loop and are ready for the **body** that we want to execute at each iteration.\n6. Each line of the **body** must be *indented*, by default Ipython will add 4 spaces for you.\n7. When the indent stops the **body** of the loop ends. \n\nThis is an example of what makes Python particularly readable as it reads like natural language, 'for (each) value in the set [ ... ]: Do something'\n\n```python\nIn [1]: for number in [2, 3, 5]:\n   ...:    #In Ipython the cursor automatically indents to help you enter the body of the loop correctly #\n```\n\nWhile the particular syntax of programming languages differ, they all have the common features, specification of the **loop variable** and **collection**, and something to indicate the stop and start of the **body**.

We can do exactly the same here.  In order to avoid using `len` we also need to increment a counter:\n\n```python\npressures = [0.273, 0.275, 0.277, 0.275, 0.276]\nsum_pressures = 0.0\nnum_pressures = 0\nfor pressure in pressures:\n    sum_pressures += pressure\n    num_pressures += 1\n    \nmean_pressure = sum_pressures / num_pressures\nprint(\"The mean pressure is:\", mean_pressure)\n```\n\nGenerally this would be considered more \"pythonic\" than the previous example, because it is more readable.  'For each index in a range the length of the list pressures ...' is not as readable as 'For each pressure in the list of pressures ...'.  We have also introduced the accumulator operator `value += new_value`.  This is the same as writing `value = value + new_value` but is shorter and easier to read."
