'For each index in a range the length of the list pressures ...' is not as readable as 'For each pressure in the list of pressures ...'.  We have also introduced the accumulator operator `value += new_value`.  This is the same as writing `value = value + new_value` but is shorter and easier to read."

    "- A `for` loop executes commands once for each value in a collection.\n",
    "- A `for` loop is made up of a collection, a loop variable, and a body.\n",
    "- Loop variables can be called anything (but it is strongly advised to have a meaningful name to the looping variable).\n",
    "- The body of a loop can contain many statements.\n",
    "- The first line of the for loop must end with a colon, and the body must be indented.\n",
    "- Indentation is always meaningful in Python.\n",
    "- Use `range` to iterate over a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "- The accumulator pattern turns many values into one."
