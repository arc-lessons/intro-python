This repository contains the lesson 'Introduction to Programming in Python', derived from the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) lessons [Programming with Python](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation) and [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder), under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
The lesson draws on the content of both lessons but is written in Jupyter notebooks rather than rst.
The material uses [nbfancy](https://github.com/JDBetteridge/nbfancy) developed by Jack Betteridge and James Grant at University of Bath.
